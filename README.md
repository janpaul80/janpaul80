### 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building AI-powered platforms, mobile/web apps, and cloud infrastructure. My work bridges design and development — helping businesses launch tools that *work beautifully* and *scale reliably*.

I’ve launched full SaaS platforms, VPN services, app generators, hosting solutions, and ecommerce tools — all while keeping UI/UX at the core of the experience.
